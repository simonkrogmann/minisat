Modifications from original

Generate a tracefile with
./minisat [options] <problem-file> <output-folder>
This offers information about the operation of the solver.
The following events are recorded:
- Backtracking
- Setting a variable
- Conflict with a variable
- Enter decision level
- Branch on a variable
- Restart
- Learn a clause
- Unlearn a clause

This data can be used for visualization in satexplorer (github.com/simonkrogmann/satexplorer),
for example highlighting the currently set variables in an incidence graph.
The functions in the header file minisat/core/Tracer.hpp are called from the
appropriate points in Minisat to allow for tracing. This file can be used to
integrate tracing into other SAT solvers.

Quick Install

- Decide where to install the files . The simplest approach is to use
  GNU standard locations and just set a "prefix" for the root install
  directory (reffered to as $PREFIX below). More control can be
  achieved by overriding other of the GNU standard install locations
  (includedir, bindir, etc). Configuring with just a prefix:

  > make config prefix=$PREFIX

- Compiling and installing:

  > make install

================================================================================
Configuration

- Multiple configuration steps can be joined into one call to "make
  config" by appending multiple variable assignments on the same line.

- The configuration is stored in the file "config.mk". Look here if
  you want to know what the current configuration looks like.

- To reset from defaults simply remove the "config.mk" file or call
  "make distclean".

- Recompilation can be done without the configuration step.
